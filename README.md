rnd(research and development)<br>
i'm a program starting 1985 to be a pioneer hacker type programmer and the developer.<br>
developing is hard but if high-level developer, it's t********<br>
<br>
//the idea makes us wisedom.<br>
//but the no idea to make the all of life which stucked.<br>
//if we're going to above first mention happy land /on idea.<br>

[programming skill lecture for beginners]<br>
1. design writing<br>
   thinking in new feature having special project.<br>
   do drawing the motive texts in paper.<br>
3. brainstorming for algorithm using in the devel.<br>
   alone possible... writing ideas on paper.
4. make architecture of the project's programs.<br>
   write pseudo-code algorithms in computer textpad.
5. code(vim?)<br>
6. release(use makefile simple) (pre alpha beta)<br>
7. code reading 70% more remembering in your understanding coding list, trouble-shooting (debugging)<br>
<br>
zen, pray for the world and space both.<br>
it helps your program's interesting.<br>
many programs on internet and hardware or usb disks?<br>
and no more new making... ?<br>
why?<br>
do it!
